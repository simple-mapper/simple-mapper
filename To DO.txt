1) Legend - make an api to be called from filters
2) Display Point Order - Move down the priority a bit
2) Export Feature
3) Line Controls - Did some basic show and unshow stuff, look to expand in a bit
4) More Styles
5) Sizing options based on spend, etc
6) Import Wizarded - Prepare for Flex Model to eventually allow for multiple files
& Allow the function to define what points are latitude and longitude
7) Map Hosting
8) Documentation
9) API for Zip Codes to Latitudes
& Likely set up a free API on IBM then have a connection to a cloudant with a defined access for only that site and API key
10) API for Routes
& Likely just do a hack where I save the requests from routing api to cloudant
